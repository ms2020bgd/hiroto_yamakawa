1st Normal Form :
- Each cell are single valued
- entries in a column are of same type
- rows are uniquely identified with an unique ID
  
2nd Normal Form : 
- 1st NF
- All attributes Non-key Columns are dependent on the key

3rd Normal Form : 
- 2 NF
- ALl columns can be determined only by the Key in the table and no other column


a composite key:
a candidate key that consists of two or more attributes (table columns) that uniquely identify an entity occurrence (table row). 

A compound key :
a composite key for which each attribute that makes up the key is a simple (foreign) key in its own right. 


Field and Columns are the same thing.

A functional dependency (FD) is a relationship between two attributes, typically between the PK and other non-key attributes within a table.

 For any relation R, attribute Y is functionally dependent on attribute X (usually the PK), if :

___________________________________________________________________________________
for every valid instance of X, that value of X uniquely determines the value of Y. 
___________________________________________________________________________________

This relationship is indicated by the representation below :

X ———–> Y

The left side of the above FD diagram is called the determinant, and the right side is the dependent.
